## Breadth First Search Algorithm

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
The current implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm will run like breadth-first, because the cost of each road is the same (1).
Note that this algorithm won't necessary give you the optimal path, and will stop on the first position where the car touches the end-point,
this happens because the end position is a point on the map and not a state of the car.
